    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This moussaka tastes great! Layers of sliced eggplant are baked in a ground beef sauce and smothered in a creamy white béchamel sauce in this classic Greek dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>3 eggplants, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch thick slices</li>

        <li>salt to taste</li>

        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>

        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Lay eggplant slices on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture, then pat dry with paper towels.</li>

        <li>Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; set aside.</li>

        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground beef, onions, and garlic; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 8 to 10 minutes, then add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Pour in tomato sauce and wine; mix well. Simmer for 20 minutes. Allow to cool, then stir in beaten egg.</li>

        <li>Cover eggplant with meat sauce, then sprinkle 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with remaining eggplant and sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top.</li>

        <li>Pour béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Cover with remaining cheese.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and browned, about 1 hour.</li>

    </ol>
